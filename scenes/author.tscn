up in my computer for you to play and to adore.

SO yoiu see, Orange Man is back in action after his world
wide acclaimed music album and his appearance in league of
scumbags, and this time he is going to have his most mysterious
adventure yet!

In order to play the game you will press the WSAD keys for
movent, and to aim your crosshair you will use the mouse.
You will press the left arrow to shoot and to click though
dialogue.
The game is sort of 3D, so bullets can come from above and
below and they can bounce, but don't worry as they have a
shadow which tells you where they are.

This game was made by the grand master of interactive
experience design::: Dr. Dany Goliath Burton.
I hope you have a fun game and death to america./"
